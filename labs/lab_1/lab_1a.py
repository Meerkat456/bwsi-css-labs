I have a deep interest in everything related with math and science and participate in my school's FTC team. I have recently completed the CS50 Introduction to Comp Sci which has given me a pretty good understanding of many programming concepts (making me familiar with Python and the Github interface). Additionally, I was a student in the Columbia Pre College Quantum Mechanics course and I look forward to applying my knowledge of physics towards this project! Lastly, I have just participated in my school's district science fair (under the environmental engineering category) and I will be moving on to regionals which will take place next week.")
